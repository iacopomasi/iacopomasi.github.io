>Please note, that in general it takes me time to reply but I do reply (it can take a long time, if the deadline for application is not close by ).
>I also process all the request in batch so please do not submit multiple forms.

### [Fill out this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfDqqM4fpUkA6bL_1Gmd8r7_yKiYmNJqohWzinQxf6gaXzPgQ/viewform) seek for applying for Ph.D. or willing to work in my group.

After reviewing your case, I will share a Google Document with some info on applying for PhD positions, in case I have any.

Please, avoid to write me a directly email since it may takes long time to reply.
