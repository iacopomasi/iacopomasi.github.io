## Teaching <a name="teaching"></a>

### Teaching Philosophy

I strongly believe in Marshall McLuhan's words: 
> Anyone who tries to make a distinction between education and entertainment doesn't know the first thing about either.

In this sense, as an educator, I will do my best to ensure that my classes are as enjoyable as possible.

### Courses
This year I teach:
  - [Foundations of coding in python](fdp)
  - Computer Architecture
