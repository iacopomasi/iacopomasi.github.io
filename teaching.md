## Teaching <a name="teaching"></a>

### Teaching Philosophy

I strongly believe in Marshall McLuhan's words: 
> Anyone who tries to make a distinction between education and entertainment doesn't know the first thing about either.

In this sense, as an educator, I will do my best to ensure that my classes are as enjoyable as possible.

### Courses
This year I teach:
  - [Fondamenti di Programmazione 🇮🇹](fdp) (Foundations of coding - python)
  - [Architettura degli Elaboratori 🇮🇹](ae) (Computer Architecture)
