<sub> Deepfake detection in videos. The figure shows our system predic- tions when trained only on FaceForensics++ for a fake video “in the wild” (left) and its pristine video (right). The heatmap bar below the video indicates the likelihood of the video being fake (red) or unmanipulated (green).</sub>
